Python Programming Labs Overview
Introduction to Input and Arithmetic Operations
This lab focuses on helping students understand Python input, arithmetic operations, variables, and conditional statements.

Objectives
Learn how to take user input.
Perform arithmetic operations.
Utilize variables effectively.
Implement conditional statements in Python.
Tools/Software Requirement
Jupyter Notebook
User-Defined Functions in Python
This lab is designed to enhance students' skills in using both built-in and user-defined functions in Python.

Objectives
Design solutions using library (built-in) functions.
Create and utilize user-defined functions in Python scripted mode.
Tools/Software Requirement
Python IDLE
Description
Python provides numerous built-in functions that facilitate common operations. Understanding how to use these functions alongside user-defined functions will enhance programming efficiency.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that helps in organizing code through the use of objects, making it modular and reusable.

Core Concepts
Objects and Classes: An object is a self-contained entity combining data (attributes) and behavior (methods). A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects.

Example: A Car class can be defined with attributes like brand and color, and methods such as drive().
Instantiation: Creating an object from a class is known as instantiation, achieved by calling the class.

Example: my_car = Car("Toyota", "blue")
Attributes: Data associated with an object, accessed via dot notation (e.g., my_car.brand).

Methods: Functions defined within a class that describe the object's behavior. Accessed through objects (e.g., my_car.drive()).

Inheritance: Allows a new class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass), promoting code reuse and extensibility.

Importance
Understanding OOP concepts such as classes, objects, methods, attributes, inheritance, and polymorphism is essential for building organized, maintainable code in Python.

Using Loops in Python
This lab focuses on familiarizing students with the use of while and for loops in Python.

Objectives
Design solutions utilizing while loops and for loops effectively.
Tools/Software Requirement
Jupyter Notebook
Description
Python offers four built-in data types for storing collections: List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary. Each type has unique characteristics and applications, and mastering these will enhance data handling capabilities in Python.

Conclusion
By completing these labs, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of Python's foundational concepts, from basic input and arithmetic to advanced topics like object-oriented programming and looping constructs. This knowledge will serve as a strong base for further exploration in Python programming.
